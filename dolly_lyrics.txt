Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waiting for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet

9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his walletFind the loneliest girl in a thousand find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you find that man and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
Find a man who wakes up every morning and lives in a world of make believe
Find someone who's arms are aching for you you find that girl and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
You're with me now so let the world forsake us
I've found my heaven here within your arms
And nothing in this world can separate us you're all I ever wanted all along
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you(Dolly Parton)

He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack 
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack 
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew 
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too 

Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 

Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday 
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made 
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing 
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine 

Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 

That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown 
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone 
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back 
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack 

Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 

Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 

Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring
You look at me that way I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me the way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames

Baby I'm burnin' out of control baby I'm burnin' body and soul
Hot as a pistol that flamin' desire baby I'm burnin' you've got me on fire
I'm on fire

This red hot emotion puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the 4th of July
There's no use in fighting this fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly

Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin'
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...




I went into his prison cell
To write his story, if he'd tell
He spoke as tears, fell from his eyes
And he told me when, and how and why
And he said

I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk, a little ways
And as we walked, then we could talk
About our future wedding day

But when she said, she could never be mine
Well I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried "my love, don't you murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity"

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I started home twixt twelve and one
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"
I've killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride

Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio

Save my soul Lord
Save my soul
There beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the OhioI thought I had seen pretty girls in my time 
But that was before I met you 
I never saw one that I wanted for mine 
But that was before I met you 
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail 
I thought I could never be blue 
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved 
But that was before I met you 

I thought I'd stay single always be free 
But that was before I met you 
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me 
But that was before I met you 

I thought I was swinging the world by the tail 
I thought I could never be blue 
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved 
But that was before I met you 

That was before I met youWhat are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this strong
True love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
[ fiddle ]
Line with temptation we raced into the past
On a road too small to let the past and the present pass
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
Long ago we let the flame...
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong




I was blue ain't sky and sea
Some of that blue's bound to get on me
But the blues don't come to stay
They'll move away on a better day

Troubles, and woes and misery
Ain't gonna get the best of me
Lift the shades, fix my gaze
On a better day, clear the way

Better days just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed
When people ain't messing with my head
There's a better way, there's a brighter day

There's a better day with clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future is looking bright
On those better days, look away, look away

Better day oh

Better days just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed
And people ain't messing with my head
There's a better day, there's a better day

I was blue it ain't sky and sea
Some of that blue's gonna fall on me
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better bay
Look away, look awayPeople always comin' up to me and askin'
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice

[Chorus]
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'

A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play

I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true

And you better get to livin'

Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true.

You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'

The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter

Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'...Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through

Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried

I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' to the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you

Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through

Climbin' up the mountain
Climbin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
Left a note I wrote I'm leaving
Won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track

Rolling, rolling, rolling down the track oh
Roll with me now

Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Blue smoke windin', i said good bye
I'm rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh I'm rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the trackI'm a brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
I must fight, I must win
I'm a brave little soldier
Through hell and back again
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill
Like david slewed galiath
I will claim this battle field

I'm a brave little soldier
I must do what I can
I'm a brave little soldier
And I must take a stand
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier

Marching, marching onward
Searching out the light of truth
I did not start the war
But it's a battle I can't lose
Faith will be my armor
And love my sword and shield
I must defeat the enemy
I will, I will, I will

A brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
A brave little soldier
A brave little soldier

I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Brave, little soldierThose lives were mine to love and cherish
To guard and guide along life's way
Oh God forbid that one should perish
That one alas should go astray
Back in the years with all together
Around the place we'd romp and play
So lonely now I oft' times wonder
Oh will they come back home some day

I'm lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling, calling
and come back home some day

I gave my all for my dear children
Their problems still with love I share,
I'd brave life's storm, defy the tempest
To bring them home from anywhere
I lived my life my love I gave them,
to guide them through this world of strife,
I hope and pray we'll live together
In that great glad here after life

I'm lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling, calling
and come back home some daySo often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again

'Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin?
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end

"Torn between two lovers" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if god loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong

I guess I should be singing "rock of ages"
"Amazing grace", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong

Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again

And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right

And torn between two lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home

I guess I should be singing "rock of ages"
"Amazing grace", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
'Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong

To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't beChristina our first born you are so soft and warm
As you lie between us softly sleeping
We gaze in admiration at God's tiny creation
And thank him and ask for your safe keeping

You were conceived through love you are a part of us
Christina you are a dream come true
We'll place you in God's hands and place you in our plans
Christina we'll take good care of you

And as we watch you grow we will always let you know
How much we love you Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you Christina Christina

You made our house a home brought joy we've never known
Christina we love you so
With innocence sweet and fair blue eyes and angel hair
Through the years we'll watch you as you grow

We'll hold your little hand we'll love you all we can
We'll try to teach you right from wrong
You are God's gift to us we can't thank him enough
For letting us have you for our own

And as we watch you grow
ChristinaBack through the years
I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fog
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for meBack through the years
I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for meEveryone needs someone they feel that they can run to
Let me be your someone the one you always come to
I wish you only happiness but that won't always be
So come to me when you're in need won't you come to me

Come to me when you're down I will help you up
When you find you need the strength that only comes from love
Let me be the one you run to in your time of need

Come to me when you're in need come to me
Come to me when you're in need and let me hide you from the world outside
Come to me when you're in need and I will dry your teardrops when you cry
Come to me let me be the one that gives you strength when you are weak
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Come to me when you're in need come to me

Won't you come to meToday tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
I'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever

We've got the kind of love most people dream about
We're sure of our love in our mind there's no doubt
And I know that you ove me by the things you do and say
And our love keeps growing stronger day after day
Today tomorrow and forever...

Each day you let me know just how much you care
And you know if you need me you know I'm always there
You don't have to say you love me over and over again
I know because you show me and I know our love won't end
Today tomorrow and forever...




(Dolly Parton)

Daddy was an old time preacher man 
He preacher the word of God throughout the land 
He preached so plain a child could understand 
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 
He told the people of he need to pray 
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day 
He preached about the great eternity 
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat 

Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify 
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By" 
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land" 
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 

Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks 
Folks came from all around to hear him preach 
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all 
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls 
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 

Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay 
For he believed that God provides a way 
We never had a lot but we got by 
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side 
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 

Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close

[Chorus:]

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, Do I ever cross your mind?

Tell me Do I ever [Repeat: x 3] 
Cross your mindOh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close

[Chorus:]

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, Do I ever cross your mind?

Tell me Do I ever [Repeat: x 3] 
Cross your mindAm I to face these lonely halls alone 
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home 
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more 
And you're the one I adore so baby 
Chorus: 

Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool 
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now) 
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel 
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now) 
You're not prepared to do anything 
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well 
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out 

My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try 
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry 
They say you're no good so baby do what you should 
And stay here by my side oh darlin' 

Repeat Chorus 

(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now) 

Don't drop out of my life 
Baby, don't drop out 
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now) 

Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now

When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright

There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright

But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore

Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright

Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell

But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright, no

Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alrightDon't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool

When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down
But I've found a new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool

When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait 
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down
But I've found a new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's foolI open up my door to greet the early morning sun 
Closing it behind me and away I do run 
To the meadow where the meadow lark
Is singing in the tree 
In the meadow I go walking
In the early morning breeze

I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly 
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild 
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me 
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze 

Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun 
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums 
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves 
In the meadow where I'm walking
In the early morning breeze 

Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray 
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day 
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees 
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze 

A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun 
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums 
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves 
In the meadow where I'm walking
In the early morning breeze(Rodney Crowell)

She's a rounder I can tell you that 
She can sing 'em all night, too 
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Especially cowgirls, they're the gypsy kind 
And need their laid on 'em loose 
She's lived to see the world turned upside down 
Hitchin' rides out of the blues 

But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Lonely nights are out there on the road 
Motel ceiling stares you down 
There must be safer ways to pay your dues 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like the restless wind 
The only way she's ever been
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and bySomething in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belongFight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
(I figured you'd mention that smart aleck)
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really

Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave

Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch

Fight and scratch fight and scratch...

Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a funny little fellow




You touch me it's like no one else ever touched me
Kiss me and all other kisses just fade
No other arms come to mind when you hold me
As if ever knew that for you, I was made

You are my joy and my laughter
You are the moon and you gave the stars light
You are my ever after
Forever love, the light of my life

You wrote the book, each page and each chapter
You are my poetry, story and song
Each moment I try to capture
All of the magic that you bring along

Fantasy, romance, story-book feelings
Wrapped as a gift sent from Heaven above
I promise I'll always love you
I'm yours, forever, love

You are my joy and my laughter
I vow to drink only from your loving cup
You are my ever after
You're mine, forever love

You are my joy and my laughter
My ever after
My forever love

My cherished
Forever loveI could hold out my arms and say "I love you this much"
I could tell you how long, I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?

From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back

I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity

From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back

I'd blow you a kiss as I wish on a star
Counting my blessings for all that you are
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back, who will love you like that, from here to the moon and backI wish I could forget you, but I won't 
I wish I loved another, but I don't 
It's just the same, day after day 
Your memory keeps getting in my way 
But I'm hoping I will be alright 
But I don't even sleep at night 
I close my eyes I see your face 
Your memory keeps getting in my way 

I don't know why I can't forget you 
I don't see why I should let you 
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday 
Your memory keeps getting in my way 

It's easy for someone to lie 
I'm saying I'll forget you and I'll try 
Here's hoping that I will someday 
Your memory keeps getting in my way 

I don't know why I can't forget you 
I don't see why I should let you 
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday 
Your memory keeps getting in my way 

There's no hope for me, I'm a girl left alone 
With crowds all around me, I feel all alone 
I can't tell my story for whom it will hurt 
And now I can see that's there's no room for me
I'm a girl left alone, there's no hope for me 
I'm tossed to and fro like a ship on a sea 
There was a mistake and now I will pay 
For those that still love me, I must go on this way

We hear the great story of the great eternity 
Where souls can be happy and I will be free 
I know I will suffer in this world eternally 
But in heaven I wonder if there'll be hope for meGo tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watch o'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shown a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain
The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth
Go tell it on the mountain

Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it on the mountainToday as I was walking
In the fields just down the way
I sat down on a fallen log
To pass the time away
And as I looked around me
The more that I did look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book

I saw a golden ray of sunlight
A silver drop of dew
A soft, white floating cloud
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue

A yellow dandelion
Pretty evergreen
And some red and orange flowers
Growing wild along the stream

And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book

The greyness in an old man's hair
The pink in baby's cheeks
The blackness in a stormy sky
The brown in fallen leaves

And the multicolored rainbow
Stretched out across the sky
And the purple haze at sunset
Just before the night

And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book

Then I turn my face toward the sky
And say a silent prayer
Though God doesn't speak to me
I see him everywhere

He is all around me
He's everywhere I look
And each new day is but a new page
In god's coloring book

Each new day is but a new page

(Dolly Parton)

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy 
There's a city where the streets are paved in gold 
A land where the milk and the honey flow 
And a mansion which for me 
'Cause my bible tells the story 
I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 

Green meadows where the little children play 
No sorrow there, just one long happy day 
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy 
I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 

And when I've reached my journey's end 
And if I'm worthy to go in 
Golden streets of glory, I walk on 
And the golden streets of my new home 
Will lead me up to the master's throne 
With the angel band I'll sing 

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy 
I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 

And when I've reached my journey's end 
And if I'm worthy to go in 
Golden streets of glory, I'll walk on 

And the golden streets of my new home 
Will lead me up to the master's throne 
With the angel band I'll sing 

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy 
I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough 
To walk upon the golden streets of glory 

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down

Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

'Cause I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)
Oh, I'll be fineA light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind

The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
Put on my tight dress
Hair teased on my head
I painted my lips red
And my eyes like Adele
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm lookin' too cool
But you never can tell

When I look in his face
My heart begins to race
It's just a disgrace
These thoughts that I think

When he holds me to him
I want to woo him
I want to undo him
And don't think I ain't

Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I'm head over high heels in love
Head over high heels in love

Oh, racing heart be still
I'm hoping he will
Make love to me 'til the sun's comin' up
Have mercy on my soul
I'm losing control
Head over high heels and I can't get enough

Well I put on my sexy dress
Hair piled on my head
Painted my lips red
I got a hot date tonight
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm feeling too cool
Even glittered my eyes

Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love, in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I am head over high heels in love

Sure enough, I'm head over high heels in love
Can't get enough
I'm head over high heels in love
I'm head over high heels in
Love

Head over high heels in loveHere I am, oh here I am, here I am

Here I am, oh here I am, oh here I am
Here I amHere you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again 
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again 
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go 
Here I go
And here I go
Here I goThe gates and doors were barred 
And all the windows fastened down 
I spent the night in sleeplessness 
And rose at every sound 
Half in hope of sorrow 
And half in fear the day 
Would find the soldiers breakin' through 
To drag us all away 
And just before the sunrise 
I heard something at the wall 
The gate began to rattle 
And a voice began to call 
I hurried to the window 
Looked down into the street 
Expecting swords and torches 
And the sound of soldiers' feet 

But there was no one there but Mary 
So I went down to let her in 
John stood there beside me 
As she told me where she'd been 
She said they've moved Him in the night 
And none of us know where 
The stone's been rolled away 
And now His body isn't there 

We both ran towards the garden 
Then John ran on ahead 
We found the stone and empty tomb 
Just the way that Mary said 
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in 
Was just an empty shell 
And how or where they'd taken Him 
Was more than I could tell 

Oh something strange had happened there 
Just what I did not know 
John believed a miracle 
But I just turned to go 
Circumstance and speculation 
Couldn't lift me very high 
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him 
Then I saw Him die 

Back inside the house again 
The guilt and anguish came 
Everything I'd promised Him 
Just added to my shame 
When at last it came to choices 
I denied I knew His name 
And even if He was alive 
It wouldn't be the same 

But suddenly the air was filled 
With a strange and sweet perfume 
Light that came from everywhere 
Drove shadows from the room 
And Jesus stood before me 
With His arms held open wide 
And I fell down on my knees 
And I just clung to Him and cried 

Then He raised me to my feet 
And as I looked into His eyes 
The love was shining out from Him 
Like sunlight from the skies 
Guilt in my confusion 
Disappeared in sweet release 
And every fear I ever had 
Just melted into peace 

He's alive yes He's alive 
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive yes He's alive 
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive 
Hallelujah He's alive 
He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive He's alive 
I believe it He's alive 
Sweet Jesus[Chorus]
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me

The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains

[Chorus]

I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me

[Chorus]Written by Jimmie Rodgers

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there




There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your door step
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you

[Chorus:]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me

You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you
What is this spell that's on me
Make me think you own me
Why do I keep holding on to you
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you

[Chorus:]Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-omeI know that you're out there
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you
In your heart and in your mind
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you
And I know that you know
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me
And when the world has chained you down
I know you know my love will set you free
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you

I have come to know and love you
Like I've never known or loved another
Words have not been made
That could describe these feelings we have for each other
And I would go to any length
To let you know at all times that I care
'Cause I want you to know
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there

How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you

Someone loves you, how does it feel to know it
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know that someone
Loves you, someone loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
Somebody loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
Someone loves you, somebody loves you
Somebody loves you, how does it feel to know it
Somebody loves youI believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you

I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget

And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus

I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone

And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan

And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus

Let the little children sing it

I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus

Let the whole world sing it with us

I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus,
I believe in Santa Claus

Let the whole world sing it with us

I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
I believe in Santa ClausThey say that love's a gentle thing
But it's only brought me pain
For the only man I ever loved
Has gone on the morning train

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

Well, the train pulled out
The whistle blew
With a long and a lonesome moan
He's gone, he's gone
Like the morning dew
And left me all alone

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

Well, there's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young man's heart
But never a change in mine

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my lifeIf I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy
And happiness
But above all of this
I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you

I will always love youIf I had wings I would fly away from
All my troubles, all my thing
And I would fly to a place of comfort
Heaven knows I need a change
If I had wings, Lord give me wings

Oh I've had my share of sorrow
Walked alone, a lonesome road
I could use a new tomorrow
If I had wings I'd make it so
One cannot predict the future
One cannot undo the past
But we can make the present useful
Build a future that will last

If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles, all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings

If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles, all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings

If I had wings, oh if I had wings
If I had wings, oh Lord just give me wings
If I had wings, if had wings I'd make a change
If I had wings, if I had wings
If I had wings, if I had wingsIF YOU SAY I CAN

WRITER DOLLY PARTON

When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments When nothing seems to work out like I planned When I think I've reached the end, just stop and reassure me Cause I can make it, if you say I can If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it In knowing you believe that much in me Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing I'm only just as strong as you make me But I can do it, if you say I can When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother When I can't seem to give what life demands When it seems impossible to make it any farther I can go on, if you say I can If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it In knowing you believe that much in me Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing I'm only just as strong as you make me But I can do it, if you say I can



Got your pajamas on
A storybook, a song
A hug so tight, a kiss goodnight
I'll leave the nightlight on
No need for you to fret
No need to be upset
I'm just outside so close your eyes
You're safe and sound at home

I'm here
I'm near
Close enough to hear you when you call
I'm here
Don't fear
'Cause I'm the one who loves you most of all
Don't cry
Here's why
You're always in my heart and on my mind
I'm here
Is that clear?
But even mommies need a little time sometimes
I'm here, I'm near, don't fear, you'll be just fine

One more time
I'm here, I'm near, don't fear, you'll be just fineI'm sixteen burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my teens
Caution to the wind, yeah
You love me and what could be
More rejuvenating, I am young again

I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
Loving you's a dream
And life is a breeze
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since I was sixteen cruisin' round the Tasty Freeze

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me

Baby, we can go to the drive-in show
Drinking Cherry Coke and Concession Trees
And maybe kiss and hug
Doing all that stuff
Always leading up
To that old back seat

I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
We're in love
Oh, happy days
You and me, we are wild and free
We'll go steady until your daddy takes the T-bird away

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me
Watch me

You and I take a little dive
In the mill pond after midnight in our birthday suit
Makin' sweet, sweet love
Meet the stars above
Sneakin' back in through the window
'Fore the clock strikes two, yeah

I'm sixteen, burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my jeans
And I feel no pain
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since drivin' my old Chevy down Lovers' Lane

It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me

Yeah, I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
Caution to the wind
I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
I'm sixteen, I feel young again

I'm sixteen
Don't I look sixteen?
You don't have to say
But I feel sixteenDarling it's not really over it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
These tiny drops of pain that's falling down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
[ guitar ]
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall




As the snow flies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
A poor little baby child is born 
In the ghetto 

And his mama cries 
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need 
It's another hungry mouth to feed 
In the ghetto 

People, don't you understand 
The child needs a helping hand 
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day 
Take a look at you and me 

Are we too blind to see 
Do we simply turn our heads 
And look the other way 

Well the world turns 
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows 
In the ghetto 

And his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal 
And he learns how to fight 
In the ghetto 

Then one night in desperation 
A young man breaks away 
He buys a gun, steals a car 
Tries to run, but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man 
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand 
In the ghetto 

As her young man dies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
Another little baby child is born 
In the ghettoYou came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real
Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real

Well you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I fullfill but is it real
Is it real this love that you have...
Is it real




Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

Sail away
Oh come sail away with me

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we areAs I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men 
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start 
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrongHmm (oh ain't he cute) ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
[ Both ]
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long

Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)




Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Your voice is soft like summer rain

Jolene, JoleneJoy to the world! The Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare Him room

And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth! The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods

Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make His blessing flow

Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as, far as the curse is found
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove

The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His loveSo I feel so blue sometimes I want to die and so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget

So I've lost the only one I've ever loved and so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes
Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
You're too much to forgetThere's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just "Someone I use to know"

Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just "Someone I use to know"

Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just "Someone I use to know"

I say just "Someone I use to know"When I was a child
Whenever I'd fall
Skinning my elbows and knees
Mommy or daddy would kiss away tears
Kiss all the places I need

Scraped, scratched to broken
A kiss was a token
That mended and cured every part

Then I grew up and fell in love
Fell so hard that it broke my heart
And now, there you are

To kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst

Damsel in distress in a red satin dress
A knight with his armor askew
Two broken hearts and all other parts
Left in lost love's residue

Came in for a drink, so I wouldn't think
To erase every thought from my head
But on second thought, I thought we ought
To see each other safely abed

Kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst

I need a shoulder to cry on, to lean on
Two loving arms to hold me
Tender words said to make me forget
And two lips to kiss me to sleep

So kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst

Kiss me tonight and make it all right
Just kiss it and make it all better

Kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst

Cause that's where it hurts the worst
Kiss it, make it better
Kiss it, make it betterIf you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we made
Are meant for breaking

What you get ain't always
What you see
But satisfaction's guaranteed
They say what you give is always
What you need
So if you want me to
Lay my hands on you

Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me

I'm a fighter, I'm a poet
I'm a preacher
I've been to school and
Baby, I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get
Up off the ground
I can show you
How to fly and never
Ever come back down

Everything you want
Is what I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever
Come for free
If you want me to lay
My hands on you

Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me

Lay your hands on me

Don't you know I only aim to please
If you want me to lay
My hands on you

Lay your hands on meLet's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold

Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours

What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be aloneAn old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing 
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I knowOh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome 
I wonder why mommy don't come 
She told me to shut up my blue eyes 
And before I woke up she'd be home 

She said she was going to see Grandma 
Who lives by the river so wide 
And I guess my mommy's feeling bad 
And perhaps she won't be home tonight 

So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy 
Perhaps he has stopped at the store 
It's a great big store full of bottles 
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore 

So out in the night with the baby 
Her little heart beating with pride 
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace 
With music all radiant with light 

Oh daddy she cried as she reached him 
I think that the music's so sweet 
But it's almost suppertime daddy 
Little blossom wants something to eat 

A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly 
Down into her face sweet and fair 
And as the demon possessed him 
He grasped at the back of a chair 

A moment a second was over 
He lifted her fair golden head 
A moment the baby's left trembled 
Then poor little blossom was dead(Dolly Parton)

Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Precious fragile little thing 
Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Flies so high and feels no pain 
All ye maidens hede my warning 
Never trust the hearts of men 
They will crush you like a sparrow 
Leaving you to never mend 
They will vow to always love you 
Swear no love but yours will do 
Then they'll leave you for another 
Break your little heart in two 

Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Precious fragile little thing 
Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Flies so high and feels no pain 

If I were a little sparrow 
O'er these mountains I would fly 
I would find him, I would find him 
Look into his lying eyes 
I would flutter all around him 
On my little sparrow wings 
I would ask him, I would ask him 
Why he let me love in vain 

I am not a little sparrow 
I am just the broken dream 
Of a cold false-hearted lover 
And his evil cunning scheme 

Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Precious fragile little thing 
Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Flies so high and feels no pain 

All ye maidens fair and tender 
Never trust the hearts of men 
They will crush you like a sparrow 
Leaving you to never mend 

Little sparrow, little sparrow 
Oh the sorrow never ends 

(Dolly Parton)

This is not at all like me 
I never thought that I could be 
So over-come by any one like this 
But you caught me by surprise 
Caught me before I realized, now 

I am lost forever in your kiss 
So take me if you want me 
Love me if you will 
For you have all control of me 
I am yours until 
You say that you don't want me 
Oh, I hope that never will be 
For I am lost forever in your kiss 

You're on my mind constantly 
On, this is all so new to me 
And when you reach for me I can't resist 
For I've become a part of you 
And I'll do anything you want me to, for 

I am lost forever in your kiss 
So take me if you want me 
Love me if you will 
For you have all control of me 
I am yours until 
You say that you don't want me 
Oh, I hope that never will be 
For I am lost forever in your kiss
Love is like a butterfly 
As soft and gentle as a sigh 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

I feel it when you're with me 
It happens when you kiss me 
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside 
Your touch is soft and gentle 
Your kiss is warm and tender 
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies 

Love is like a butterfly 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

Your laughter brings me sunshine 
Everyday is spring time 
And I am only happy when you are by my side 
How precious is this love we share 
How very precious, sweet and rare 
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies 

Love is like a butterfly 
As soft and gentle as a sigh 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thingWhat are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good,
'Cause I know your kind!
If you wanna be mine,
We gotta get this understood!

Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your special of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in hell for you, for sure
If you think that I will be your, be your lover du jour
Pas moi (Lover du jour), not me!

I am well aware of your good looks and sexy ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day, on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready, just having it your way

Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't even place your order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie

No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French but there's no chance in hell that I endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
Oubliez-moi (Lover du jour), forget me!

Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merde from you! (That's crap!)

If you want something appetizing
Something real and satisfying
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way!

'Cause, I'm not gonna be your, be your amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
'Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour!

No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour!
The special of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour!
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour!
Your lover du jour!
Hm hm hm c'est dommage (Too bad!)

Now, I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you're nothing but trouble!
Ooh you're a bad bad boy! (Amour du jour)
I am a tasty starter around a full course meal
Desert after dinner drink, and you can have your fill

Pardon my French
Tu ne causes que des ennuis
Tu es un mauvais garçon
Any questions? (Haha)
Oh my French is awful but my love is awesome
(Haha) Ooh, they're gonna laugh at me in France
Sorry (Hahaha)Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Making believe, its all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe

Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do

Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believeWell I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
'Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me

His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
'Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old red hen
'Cause he's gonna marry me

Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's aprin strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
'Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me

Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's aprin strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
'Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me

Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-deLate one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a'barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms

Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said

Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakers man
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you

Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry

London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you

She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone

Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) AndyMmm-mmm, miss me
Don't you miss and want to hold me now and then
And kiss me and tell me I'm your little girl again?
Daddy, when you left
Did you remove yourself from ever sweet remembrance of me?
I'm always missin' you, I hope you miss me, too
And everything we were and still could be
Miss little things like walkin' in the park
Miss summer nights with fireflies in a jar
Vague mem'ries of you playing your guitar
Miss all of this, it's true
But mostly I miss you
'Cause no one else could ever take your place
And Mama, don't you miss the things that home is all about
And, oh the drama caused by the anger you keep actin' out?
Why can't you both just see, you didn't divorce me
Forgive, forget and try to get along
I miss us bein' close. I love and miss you both
Don't miss the plea I've written in my song
Your little miss is missing out on you
And you're both missing out on so much, too
Put pride aside and do what you should do
Don't make me have to choose,
I love the both of you
Just let resentment go and think of me
You've torn my world apart
It breaks my little heart
Can't you see me and see me missin' you?
I miss you, miss me
I miss you, miss me
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I miss you(Dolly Parton)

Pretty as an angel from the day that she was born 
Skin as fair as Lily's hair, as golden as the corn 
They knew that she was special from the moment she first cried 
She was a mountain angel certified 
She was her momma's baby, she was her daddy's pride 
Good at home, at church and school, at everything she tried 
Everybody's darlin' led a charmed and peaceful life 
The perfect mountain angel 'til he arrived 
And ohh, she fell so deeply 
Ooh, she couldn't stop 
She gave herself to him, milled it completely 
He lifted her so high he let her drop 

She gave up everything for him that mattered in her life 
All the others that had loved her and she vowed to be his wife 
She dreamed of bearing children in an ivy-covered house 
The mountain angel's sunshine turned to clouds 
The wicked handsome stranger left the way he came 
Broke her heart and broke her mind 
She never was the same 
They say he was the devil 
That had come to steal her soul 
She never loved another it was told 
They say she had a baby 
Some say that it had died 
They it's just as well 
As it had been the devil's child 
They say good conquers evil 
But here, evil won the prize 
So the mountain angel took to the wild 

And ooh, she couldn't take it 
Years passed and she had long since lost her mind 
She waited for him as her beauty faded 
Her parents died from grief before their time 

She tried to gather pieces of her life, they wouldn't fit 
Beside the tiny grave deep in the woods is where she'd sit 
Talking to the child, herself, to him, who knew for sure 
Possessed they say by satan's insane lure 
High a'top the mountain, for years they say she's seen 
Looking down upon the town where she had once been queen 
She'd sneak around the playground, watch the little children play 
They'd see the crazy lady then run away 
They say she roamed these hills for years, wearing not a stitch 
The lovely mountain angel now thought to be a witch 
She made those wailing mournful sounds 
That you could hear for miles 
Long after she laid down upon her baby's grave and died 

And ooh, her ghost is callin' 
She's waiting for the ones that she adored 
Through spring and summer, fall when snow is fallin' 
Her spirit roams these hills forever more 
The mountain angel's voices ever more 

Oohh, oooo 
Oohh, oooo 
Oohh, oooo 

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover

Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci

And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam

Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream(Dolly Parton)

Fly away from my window little blue bird 
Fly as far as you can away from here 
And let not your song fall upon my ear 
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears 
For the one that I have loved 
He has left me and gone 
An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song 

Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine 
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here 
Oh, trouble me not 
Go ye elsewhere 
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears 

For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away 
An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today 

Go spread your blue wings 
Go light your blue sky 
An' I'll shed my blue tears 

(Dolly Parton)

Fly away from my window little blue bird

An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song 

Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine 
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here 
Oh, trouble me not 
Go ye elsewhere 
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears 

For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away 
An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today 

Go spread your blue wings 
Go light your blue sky 
An' I'll shed my blue tears

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me

She stepped off of the boat to see flowers in his hands
The man she would marry was as hard as the mountains
She had his children in a log cabin
Soon I'd be another star in this family's constellation
In the land of the midnight sun
Searching for gold
I am my father's daughter
He has his mother's eyes
I am the product of her sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter

My father raised me in an old log cabin
And he sang for me the songs his mother sang to him
In honky-tonks, and empty bars, just me and him
And that old guitar
He passed on a legacy wrapped up in a melody
And I carry on
Searching for gold

I am my father's daughter
I have his eyes
I am the product of his sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter

And every time I step on stage

And the music finds me

I don't need gold to remind me

I am my father's daughter
I have my Grandma's eyes
I am the product of such sacrifice

I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter
Oh, I am my father's daughterSittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by

Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by

Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near byI may not climb that Everest
Win praise in others' eyes
I may not win the lottery
Win the Pulitzer Prize
I may not sail the ocean
In a blown-apart canoe
But I will never, never not love you

I might not be in fashion
Might not be all that smart
Might not be that good-lookin'
Not someone set apart

Might not stand in the spotlight
That shines upon the pew
But I will never, never not love you

I will never not
Light up when I see you
I will never not
Feel you through and through
There are many things
I may or may not do
But I will never, never not love you

I may not offer riches
Or make a bed to do
I may not give you many things
That you're accustomed to
I may not be worthy of you
I just hope my love will
'Cause I will never, never not love you

No matter where you are
No matter what you do
I will not be caught
Not loving you

May not set world records
But I can promise you
That I will never, never not love
You

No I will never, never not love youDowntown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who 
I used to take comfort from long before I met you 
I caught a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire 
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire 

But old flames can't hold a candle to you 
No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Oh yeah
Ooh ooh

Like sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known 
And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone (feel so alone)
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone 
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn 

But old flames can't hold a candle to you 
No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Oh yeah (ooh)
Oh oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Ah (ah!)
Ah! 
Ah yeah 
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
Candle to you
Old flames (oh yeah)
Old flames (oh yeah)
Old flames (oh yeah)
Old flames (oh yeah)
Can't hold a candle to youOnce more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

Forget the past this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say you'll love me
And say you'll give me all of your heart

Once more to be with you dear...

Once more to be with you dear...Darlin', I'm outside your door
Knowin' you'll welcome me in
Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right
Bein' here with you again

Might not be the right thing to do
But I swear it doesn't feel wrong
Might not be forever, but never say never
I'm standin' outside of your door

I guess I should feel cheap
But I just can't keep
My mind and my hands off of you
The way we make love
Is so far above
Anything I ever knew

So here I am, I'm outside your door
Knowin' what's waitin' inside
Heaven on earth and for all that it's worth
We'll be here til we're both satisfied

Two bottles of wine, one white and one red
Few drinks to unwind, and then be off to bed
We can't fight this passion, no need to pretend
And oh yes, I'll be outside your door again

Darlin', I'm outside your door
And I know you welcome me in
(Don't have to knock twice)
It feels so right
Just bein' here with you again
Yeah, I'm standin' outside of your door (once more)
And I know you'll welcome me in

Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right
Standin' outside of your door, once more
I'm standin' outside of your door
(Outside your door)
Once more
(Outside your door)Ping pong 
I use to like 
Ping pong 
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you 
Ping pong 
It scares me now 
Ping pong 
My heart is the ball in a ding dong, ping pong game with you 

I serve it to you 
And you knock it back 
You hit it so hard, hard, hard 
Its startin' to crack 

Ping pong 
You're smashed again 
Ping pong 
And I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you 

I serve it to you 
And you knock it back 
You hit it so hard, hard, hard 
Its starting to crack 

Ping pong 
You're smashed again 
Ping pong 
I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you 

Ping pong 
I use to like 
Ping pong 
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you

It scares me now...Writer Dolly Parton

The mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him December was pleasant as May
There once was a time he and I picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fair
No difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not where did the snow
Or green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
Now the mid summer sun shines...
Sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to me
For ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken I'll be
Now the mid summer sun shines...
The mid summer sun shines but dim mmm

We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry 
We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life 
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns 
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down 

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
So please, please, please
Oh please let me grow old with you 

We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around 
We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground 
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns 
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down 

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
So please, please, please
Oh please let me grow old with you 

But tied to the same track, the two of us look back 
At oncoming trains ahead 
How many more times can we lay on the line 
Watching our love hang by a thread

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
So please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you
Oh please, please, oh please let me grow old with youCome on down have a look around at rich folks living in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love that's one thing that we've got a plenty of
So come on down have a look around at rich folks living in a poor folks town

We got no carpets on the floor we've got wall to wall love who could ask for more
We got no fancy things to show just a place to watch our children grow
So come on down...

We got no big fine car to drive and no fancy clothes to keep in style
We're rich in things that life can give that can't be bought with a dollar bill
So come on down...
[ fiddle ]
Got a little simple church near by and the promise of a mansion in the sky
Got a heart of gold a million dollar smile and satin clouds at silvery line
So come on down...
So come on down...




As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
As a young man I'd go a courtin' with my sweetheart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler that's where he'd always find me waitin' there
Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walkin' neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Then one evening in Possum Holler my sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah we got married in Possum Holler just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Now when they see a possum hunter young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin' cause we know there ain't no possum there
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
About possum in Possum HollerPuppy love, puppy love
They all call it puppy love
I'm old enough now to kiss and hug
And I like it, it's puppy love

Pullin' my pig tails makes me mad
When you kiss me, makes me glad
You turn to leave and make me sad
Still you're the sweetest sweetheart I've ever had

Puppy love, puppy love
They all call it puppy love
I'm old enough now to kiss and hug
And I like it, it's puppy love

Puppy love, puppy love

They all call it puppy love
I'm old enough now to kiss and hug
And I like it, it's puppy love

Sometimes you won't even carry my books
The next time you'll see me you'll rag on my looks
You're meaner to me than a mean ole crook
And I must confess I'm really hooked

Puppy love, puppy love
They all call it puppy love
I'm old enough now to kiss and hug
And I like it, it's puppy loveEvery time I think about you
I get chills along my spine
It's a feeling I'm not used to
Can't believe you're really mine

Other love's so complicated
Broken hearts and twisting minds
Then you came and I'm elated
So unlike the other times

It's so pure it's almost sacred
Simply put, it feels divine
I just love you pure and simple
Pure and simple and sublime

Don't it seem we've spent a lifetime
Looking for that perfect love
Like a dream we finally found it
Pure and simple, well good for us

It's so pure it's almost sacred
Simply put, it feels divine
I just love you pure and simple
Pure and simple, sweet and fine
I just love you pure and simple
Can't believe you're really mine
Mmm (pure and simple)Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're goin' away but leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough todayCindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone

Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel




"Hey Miley
It's me, I'm in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, can't
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my, CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone, too
But anyhow, see what you think
And um, here I go"

Come on

Living in a Rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned
And I smile
'Cause I know if we try, we could really make a difference in this world
I won't give up, I'll sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think, you know where I stand
I believe we can start living in a Rainbowland

Living in a Rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lying if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine on through
Together, we can start living in a Rainbowland

Living in a Rainbowland
The skies are blue and things are grand
Wouldn't it be nice to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right
And end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win (come on)

Living in a Rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lying if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine on through
Together, we can start living in a Rainbowland

Living in a Rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together (let's do it together)
Chase dreams forever
I know there's gonna be a greener land
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine on
Together, we can start living in a Rainbowland

"Hey Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
Wish I could do a little better
At least, I might not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well"Please release me, let me go 
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
And to live without love is a sin 
So release me and let me love again 

I have found a new love, dear 
And I'll always want him near 
His lips are warm while yours are cold 
So release me, my darlin' let me go 

Oh please release me, let me go 
'Cause I just won't love you anymore 
And to live together we both know is a sin 
So release me, release me and let me love again 

Oh, please, please, please, please 
Release me, let me go 
'Cause I, I don't love you anymore 
And to live together is a sin 
So release me and let me love again 

Oh, please release me, let me go 
I don't love you anymore 
And to live together is a sin 
So release me and let me love againNow every Tom, Dick, Harry or Hank

There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!

Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.

Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part



Sacred mem'ries often take me to the place where I grew up
And that little country church that I love so much
I used to go there every time that old church bell would ring
And I remember how I love the songs we used to sing
Like oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home oh Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

They were singing Lord I'm coming on when I got saved
And when I got baptized they sang amzaing grace
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sang my favorite song if we never meet again
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beutiful shore

My mama loved to sing and she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear mama now
I recall the song my mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest sangin' power in the blood
Oh there's power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
Sacred mem'ries




Say forever you'll be mine 
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding 
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding 
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time 
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine 

Trouble clouds may fill our skies 
It might even rain awhile 
But the rain will go away 
There's always a brighter day 

Darling, I won't promise you 
That we'll be happy all the time 
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine 
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine

Tell me will love be there
ShineI don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
You ought to go north somebody told us
Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd lived so long on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land

Just poor Smoky Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
Cause there was no land of promise
Though it's a stuggle just keepin' sight of who you are

Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And they're all thinking of me
The Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

You know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
You go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands

Oh and these northern nights they're dreary
And my southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
He'll love and guide and lead us
The Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

If I'll keep looking to the father
Keep our heads above the water
While the Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong




I thumbed my way from LA back to Knoxville
I found those bright lights ain't where I belonged
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams, I'm comin' home
But tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone

Smoky Mountain rain, it keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smoky mountain rain, I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
"I've got to find her can you make these big wheels burn"?

Smoky Mountain rain, it keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smoky mountain rain, I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain

I can't blame her for lettin' go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain runnin' down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes

Smoky Mountain rain, it keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smoky mountain rain, I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
Smoky Mountain rain, it keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her nameSomewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way mhm
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way we stumbled and oh and we fell
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way mhm




We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me want to call you sweet names at the waking of each day
For each day I love you more and we won't ever take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take awayAs you walk away 
As we say good-bye 
What I wouldn't give 
For a tender lie 
Say you'll never stop loving me 
Just as if it were true 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 
When we fall so far 
Are we wrong to try? 
To keep out the truth 
With a tender lie 
Say you're gonna come back to me 
And I'll believe that it's true 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 

Say you're gonna come back to me 
And I'll believe that it's true 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do?Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Well, I've sacrificed time with family and friends
Gave up vacations for work without end
Twenty four seven, three hundred and sixty five
But I was willing to make the sacrifice

But empty or full, I've carried my pail
You don't drink the water if you don't dig the well
Through blood sweat and tears I have built a good life
But it didn't come without sacrifice

But I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
All through the years I kept my eye on the prize
You ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice

I think about Jesus and all that he gave
And the ultimate sacrifice that he made
He is my strength and my guiding light
And he's taught me that nothing's without sacrifice

I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
I wanted success and, brother, I've paid the price
And, yes, it's been worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice

I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
Grindstones and rhinestones have made up my life
But I've shined like a diamond through sacrifice

I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
But I hope God will tell me, 'Well done, my child
You've won your reward through your sacrifice, the sacrifice'
The sacrifice

But sometimes I wonder in the still of the night
Is it really worth the sacrifice
I've often laughed and I've often cried
I've often failed but I've always tried
I made the sacrifice
The sacrificeAll of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules
But, baby, I broke them all for you
Because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what
I've been through like you do
And I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you
It's true, I was made for youThere'll be love love love oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love

God created man and woman at the start and he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love...
[ guitar ]
For every person somewhere there's a mate it's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love
You can lock a man behind a prison wall and you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love...

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
The only things that seemed to be 
Important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

Being took for granted
Was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

One morning we awoke, just to find the note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy

She said, "Our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on"
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

Mama's gone
Goodbye to daddyTo know, know, know him 
Is to love, love, love him 
Just to see him smile 
Makes my life worthwhile 
To know, know, know him 
Is to love, love, love him 
And I do 

I'll be good to him 
I'll bring love to him 
Everyone says there'll come a day 
When I'll walk alongside of him 
Yes, just to know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do 

Why can't he see 
How blind can he be?
Someday he will see 
That he was meant for me, oh

To know, know, know him 
Is to love love love him 
Just to see him smile 
Makes my life worthwhile 
To know, know, know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I doYou and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me
[ piano ]
Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together...

All the mountains, oceans, tides, long as you are by my side
We'll come out, alright
Together

Together
You and I should always stay together
Forever

Adventures can be fun
As long as there's someone
Besides you that can share in your "whatever"s
And even when you stray
You'll always find a way
And that's why you and I must stay together

Together
Together
You and I should always stay together

So let's be friends for life
Let's see eye to eye
Forever you and I
Together

Together
Together
You and I should always stay together
Forever
Forever
You and I should always stay together
You and I should always stay together
Don't you think? Let's stay togetherMy love for you is deeper than the depth of any ocean
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night
As constant as the sun making its journey through the heavens
And we will always be together, you and I

Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we will always be together, you and I

Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
You know we will always be together, you and I

Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we'll always be together, you and I

I'll always be beside or close behind you (together, together)
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you

Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky (together, together)
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we'll always be together, you and I
We'll always be together, you and I

Forever together
Together forever, you and I (together, together)
Forever together
Together you and I will always be (together, together)
Together you and ITake my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot no looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
Yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
No more crying tears leave tracks and mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waking let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is forever
I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time my love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you no never
Yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is foreverI have chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountains, soared the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried

I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try

So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be one that make a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside

And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again

Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one that keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try

So try to be the first one up that mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly

And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you won't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
'Cause you'll never really know if you don't try

You gotta try
Come give it a try
You have to try
I know it ain't easy, who ever said it was
Life is hard, same as it ever was
You have to try (You have to try)

When you think you can't do it just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little further but try (try)
You have to try (try)

What every it is you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you I know you can do it
Just try (try) 
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and take it for a while (give it a try)
At least you know you tried (give it a try)

Don't think that I don't suffer
I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place where I start praying
And I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I tryyin' across my lonely bed in this lonely old apartment
Cryin' about the way that life's been kickin' me around
My love of yesterday is gone but he promised no tomorrow
But they're feelin' no sorrow two doors down

Two doors down they're laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party
But two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
But here I am, cryin' my heart out, feelin' sorry
They're havin' a party just two doors down

I think I'll cry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down, yeah

Two doors down they're laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party (Ooh)
But two doors down they're not aware that I'm around (Alright, now, hey hey)
But here I am, cryin' my heart out, feelin' sorry (Ooh, yeah baby)
They're havin' a party just two doors down

I can't believe I'm standin' here, dry-eyed, all smiles and talkin'
Making conversation with a new love I've found
And I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we' start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waitin' two doors down, yeah

Two doors down they're laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party (Yeah baby)
But two doors down they're not aware that I'm around (Whoa)
But here I am, cryin' my heart out, feelin' sorry (Sorry)
They're havin' a party just two doors down (Yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, two doors down, I'll be there, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, two doors down, yeah

Two doors down they're laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party (Yeah)
Two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
But here we am, feelin' everything but sorry (Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything)
Havin' our own party two doors down (Hey, yeah)

Havin' our own party
Workin' and drinkin', baby
Havin' a party
Two doors down
Two doors down they're laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party
Havin' our own party two doors down, woo
Two doors down we're havin' a party
Havin' our own party two doors down
Party, party, party
Party, party, party
Havin' our own party two doors down
I'll be there
I'll be there
Havin' our own party two doors down
Two doors down
Laughin' and drinkin' and havin' a party
Two doors down
Two doors downTwo little children, a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet 
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's clothes were all tattered and torn
They shone beneath his blue eyes

"Why don't you go home 
To your mommy," I said
And this was the maiden's reply
"Mommy's in heaven 
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone"

Mommy got sick 
Angels took her away 
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come 
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early 
To ring the church bell
And found them 
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that nightTwo sides to every story we can't stay this out if we'll take time
Two sides to every story you tell yours and I tell mine

Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that

There's always two sides to every story...

You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' who

There's always two sides to every story...
There's always two sides to every story...I thought I'd been in love before but so did you
I thought that I would love no more but so did you
We'll always be together forever yours forever mine
You and me you and me are two of a kind
There's so much between you and me like sadness disappointment jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me you and me are two of a kind
I've made promises to you that I couldn't keep
And you know I've said things to you that I didn't mean
We've made our vows and we can never break the ties that bind
You and me you and me are two of a kind
There's so much between you and me...Like the Phoenix
From the ash and dirt
I rose up from the pain and hurt
When I was at my very worst
I found you

Thought I could never love again
When a spark of light came beaming in
A thread of hope
For me to spin around you

Unlikely angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together

Unlikely angel
It feels so right inside your love
Like God has sent you from above
To honor, cherish, and to love forever

The smile upon your angel face
The heaven in your eyes replace
The hell that I've been going through
Before you

How long have you been there for me
I once was blind but now I see
A future full of hope
How I adore you

Unlikely angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together

Unlikely angel
You never know where one might be
In sacred halls or crowded streets
But God sent one straight down to me from heaven

Unlikely angel ahh ahh
Unlikely angel
Ahh ahh, unlikely angel
Unlikely angel
Hmm ahh ahh,

Unlikely angelThe wind can blow cold, it moans and it cries
When it carries the sound of a thousand goodbyes
But if you listen tonight on that high, lonely plain
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name

You've been on a road that just don't seem to end
Where that broken old heart of yours won't ever mend
You've crossed over bridges and bridges they burn
So many rivers and so much to learn
So many bridges and so much to learn

But the moon is so full, the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady, my touch id light
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight

We both have known hard luck
And love that's gone wrong
When the ghosts take the shadows and
The night takes too long
We folded our cards when the hand wasn't strong
But that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone
Yeah, that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone

And the moon is so full, the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady, my touch is light
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight and I'll
Waltz you my darling across Texas tonight

I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you my darling across texas tonightThe wind can blow cold, it moans and it cries

But if you listen tonight on that high, lonely plain
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name

You've been on a road that just don't seem to end
Where that broken old heart of yours won't ever mend
You've crossed over bridges and bridges they burn
So many rivers and so much to learn
So many bridges and so much to learn

But the moon is so full, the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady, my touch id light
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight

Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never over us all to reign

Star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I, my gift of love and sacrifice
Prayer and praising all men raising worshiping God most high 

Oh, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us ti Thy perfect light

On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

I'm gonna walk with my grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck

Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do
But when I get where I'm going
And I see my Maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of His amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah, when I get where I'm goingWhen I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

Well, the worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

Now, you may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the sky
But you can't teach my heart to forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving youTrouble, we have known trouble 
In our struggle just to get by 
Many times the burden's been heavy 
Still we carried on side by side 

[Chorus]
And when we're gone long gone 
The only thing that will have mattered 
Is the love that we shared 
And the way that we cared 
When we're gone, long gone 

And when we're walking together in glory 
Hand in hand through eternity 
It's the love that will be remembered 
Not wealth, not poverty 

[Chorus]I wanna feel this way
Longer than time
I wanna know your dreams
And make them mine
I wanna change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I wanna do

I wanna hold you close under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

In a world without you (without you)
I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love meI wanna feel this way
Longer than time
I wanna know your dreams
And make them mine
I wanna change the world
Only for you

When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love meI'm so tired, I need sleep
I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?
I make mistakes, but them's the breaks
I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a new world
Just not today

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it?

Life's a bitch, and so am I
If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a new world
Just not today

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it?

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a new world
Just not today

Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you, why can't you
So tough when no-one knows you
No homies, so lonely
Why don't you cry about it now?The hills were alive with wildflowers and I
Was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run
They just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place

Just a wild mountain rose
Needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

And the flowers I knew
In the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close
I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out

So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

I grew up fast and wild
And I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged
I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free

I hitched a ride with the wind
And since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

Wildflowers don't care where they growThe hills were alive with wildflowers and I
Was as wild, even wilder than they

Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?

Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of, in the name of love
What a man he was

Love went to waste when the sexy lace couldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be good? And I know you could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? Lord, I know you could

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Now wouldn't that be great?What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start,
The way you always do?

When somebody knocks at the door,
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands,
But you can't make old friends

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was me and you, since way back when
But you can't make old friends

How will I sing when you are gone?
'Cause it won't sound the same
Who'll join in on those harmony parts,
When I call your name?

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
You can't make old friends

When Saint Peter opens the gate,
And you come walking in
I'll be there just waiting for you
'Cause you can't make old friends
'Cause you can't make old friends, no no

When I'm out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
But you can't make old friends, no no

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again
You can't make old friends

You and me, will be together again
'Cause we both know, we will still be old friends

You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always beenAll your love lifting me higher 
Than I ever been lifted before 
So keep it up, quench my desire 
Then I'll be at your side forevermore 

You know your love keeps on lifting me higher 
Higher and higher 
I said your love keeps on lifting me 
Higher and higher 

Now once I was downhearted 
This little loneliness my foes and friend 
But when you came, he soon departed 
And he never showed his face again 

You know your love keeps on lifting me higher 
Higher and higher 
I said your love keeps on lifting me 
Higher and higher 

I'm so glad I finally found you 
Yes that one in a million girl 
And now with my loving arms around you 
I can stand up and face the world 

You know your love keeps on lifting me higher 
Higher and higher 
I said your love keeps on lifting me 
Higher and higher
